## Python - Hedging & Trading
<br/>
<br/>
### Here is my python repository for hedging and trading examples from around the internet that I either found interesting or wanted to see work in a real environment using libraries like alphaVantage or yfinance. 
#
If you like this repository, please give it a star. 
#
I am available to contact about the code, consulting, or just saying hi.
#
If you have a project idea or would like to see something specific, contact me.
