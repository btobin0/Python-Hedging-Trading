## Python - Hedging & Trading



#### Here is my python repository for hedging and trading examples that I found interesting or wanted to see work in a real environment. Used libraries _*AlphaVantage*_ or _*yfinance*_ for envirment analysis and testing. 

#### If you have a project idea or have any suggestions, I am available to contact about the code, consulting, or just saying hi.

#### If you like this repository, please give it a star.
