## Python - Hedging & Trading



#### Here is my python repository for hedging and trading examples that I found interesting or wanted to see work in a real environment. Used libraries _*AlphaVantage*_ or _*yfinance*_ for the analysis and testing envirment. 

#### If you have a project idea or have any suggestions, please let me know.

#### Feel free to contact about the code, consulting, or just saying hi.
